# Stock Analysis Challenge
This is an analysis of Green Energy stocks using Visual Basic for the purposes of advising our friend Steve and his parents on investing. This analysis looks at the Green Energy stocks and their intial trading values, trading volumes, and final trading values to asses and annual returns for 2017 and 2018.

##Project Overview
The stock market can be overwhelming, making it difficult to determine where best to invest. This project utilized several VBA coding tools such as arrays, loops, and conditionals to analyze a large amount of information and creat a report of the annual findings. Developer buttons were inlcuded to make it easy for any user to run the code, with a simple interactive input box and color-coded results to call out the gains and losses on annual returns. With these tools Steve and his parents can make better investing decisions.

###Layout
The workbook includes 4 tabs, two data tabs containing 2017 and 2018 stock market data respectively, an "All Stocks Analysis" tab, and a "DQ Analysis" tab. The data tabs contain Green Energy stock tickers, trading dates, opening stock prices, highest daily stock prices, lowest daily stock prices, closing (and adjusted closing) stock prices, and the stock volume traded. The "All Stocks Analysis" tab contains two developer buttons, one for running the VBA code that asks the user for the year they want to assess and creats a table of results by stock ticker, and one for clearing the worksheet. Similarly, the "DQ Analysis" tab contains similar developer buttons, but instead of looking at all Green Energy stocks it analyzes only DQ stocks.
